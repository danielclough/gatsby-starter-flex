### Lapu Land --- 

Long ago, in the distant land of Lapu, a very pious rice farmer had fallen on hard times. The Emperor of Heaven far far away, and the Emperor of Lala was not worth bowing to... if you value honor more than your head.

> The farmer, Mr. Li had **taxes** to pay, **bills** to pay, <small>*and between you and me*</small> **Gambling Debt**.

The mob wasn't too keen to break his leg. They lived on interest paid in the form of *rice*, *rice* flower, *rice* noodles, *rice* pancakes... and lot's of rice wine.

But, the magistrate actually **owned** *all the rice* - on behalf of the emperor - and *all the labor in the land*. It is as if *when he eats* **the emperor eats**. And, when he **kills** *a no good farmer* for ***not paying his taxes*** - it is ***divine justice***.

## Mr. Li prayed and prayed, but was anyone listening?

#### As it turned out *someone was*.

The ***Spirit of Tea*** had always taken an interest in this particular farmer. In a dream the spirit came to the farmer, and upon placing one hand into the rice pond - the ground rose to the sky forming steep mountains - the sky burned - and rained matcha rice crispies.

> *When the farmer woke*, he found that the mobsters and corrupt authorities had *perished in the earthquake*. ***Magically*** fullgrown tea plants were growing *wild on the cliffside*. ***Monkeys*** *were collecting tea*, and *all seemed right in the world*.

### After a very long nap Mr. Li woke to find that the beautiful green tea had already started to oxidize. 

> In order to *save the tea*, for afterall, he would *owe back taxes*... he ***smoked*** the tea over a *smoldering fire* in order to dry it quickly to bring to market.

#### It was fantastic! And, the *rich barbarians* from across the oceans couldn't get enough of the stuff. 

> Te barbarians called the **Smoked Tea** *Lapushan Xiaozhong* - or **Lapsang Souchong** - and now you know the long lost truth of the **Original Mountain Small Variety** (正山小种; Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong) - aka. Lishan Xiaozhong.
